---layout: default---# History of C_Sharp
During the development of the.NET Framework, theclass librarieswere originally written using amanaged codecompiler system called"Simple Managed C"(SMC).[22][23]In January 1999,Anders Hejlsbergformed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-likeObject Oriented Language".[24]Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries andASP.NETruntime had been ported to C#.
Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved with the design ofTurbo Pascal,Embarcadero Delphi(formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi), andVisual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws[25]in most major programming languages (e.g.C++,Java,Delphi, andSmalltalk) drove the fundamentals of theCommon Language Runtime(CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.
James Gosling, who created theJavaprogramming language in 1994, andBill Joy, a co-founder ofSun Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."[26][27]In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is "not a Java clone" and is "much closer to C++" in its design.[28]
Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition ofgenericsto both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use ofreificationto provide "first-class" generic objects that can be used like any other class, withcode generationperformed at class-load time.[29]Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in theLINQextensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework oflambda expressions,extension methods, andanonymous types.[30]These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques, such asclosures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount ofboilerplate codethat is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.[31]
C# used to have amascotcalled Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). It was retired on January 29, 2004.[32]
C# was originally submitted to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 subcommitteeSC 22for review,[33]under ISO/IEC 23270:2003,[34]was withdrawn and was then approved under ISO/IEC 23270:2006.[35]The 23270:2006 is withdrawn under 23270:2018 and approved with this version.[36]
## Name[edit]
Microsoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation.[37]That project was not completed, and the name was later reused.
The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation whereby asharp symbolindicates that the written note should be made asemitonehigher inpitch.[38]This is similar to the language name ofC++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles aligatureof four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.[39]
_ Corrupted text _
The "sharp" suffix has been used by a number of other .NET languages that are variants of existing languages, includingJ#(a .NET language also designed by Microsoft that is derived from Java 1.1),A#(fromAda), and thefunctional programminglanguageF#.[41]The original implementation ofEiffel for .NETwas called Eiffel#,[42]a name retired since the fullEiffellanguage is now supported. The suffix has also been used forlibraries, such asGtk#(a .NETwrapperforGTKand otherGNOMElibraries) andCocoa#(a wrapper forCocoa).
