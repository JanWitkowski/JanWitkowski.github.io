# History of Java
![/assets/Java.png](/assets/Java.png)
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, andPatrick Naughtoninitiated the Java language project in June 1991.[21]Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[22]The language was initially calledOakafter anoaktree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the nameGreenand was finally renamedJava, fromJava coffee, a type of coffee fromIndonesia.[23]Gosling designed Java with aC/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[24]
Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[25]It promisedwrite once, run anywhere(WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popularplatforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Majorweb browserssoon incorporated the ability to runJava appletswithin web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-writtenin JavabyArthur van Hoffto comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[26]With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998      1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.J2EEincluded technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions asJava EE,Java ME, andJava SE, respectively.
In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached theISO/IEC JTC 1standards body and later theEcma Internationalto formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[27][28][29]Java remains ade factostandard, controlled through theJava Community Process.[30]At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite theirproprietary softwarestatus. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) asfree and open-source software(FOSS), under the terms of theGPL-2.0-onlylicense. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available underfree software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[31]
Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as anevangelist.[32]FollowingOracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009  10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[33]This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside theAndroid SDK(see theAndroidsection).
On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned fromOracle.[34]
In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin.[35]
Java software runs on everything from laptops todata centers,game consolesto scientificsupercomputers.[36]
Oracle(and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to unresolved security issues in older versions.[37]
## Principles
There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:[17]
## Versions
As of September  2023[update], Java 8, 11, 17 and 21 are supported asLong-Term Support(LTS) versions.[38]
Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for thelegacyversionJava 8LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java  8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offerzero-cost buildsof OpenJDK 18 and 8, 11 and 17 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.[citation needed]
