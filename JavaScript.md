# History of JavaScript

## Creation at Netscape
The first popularweb browserwith agraphical user interface,Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the earlyWorld Wide Web.[12]The lead developers of Mosaic then founded theNetscapecorporation, which released a more polished browser,Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13]
During these formative years of the Web,web pagescould only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add aprogramming languageto Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating withSun Microsystemsto embed theJavalanguage, while also hiringBrendan Eichto embed theSchemelanguage.[6]
The goal was a "language for the masses",[14]"to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactiveWeb sites".[15]Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extantscripting languages.[5][6]Although the new language and itsinterpreterimplementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigatorbetain September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16]
The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, thedot-com boomhad begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.[14]
## Adoption by Microsoft
MicrosoftdebutedInternet Explorerin 1995, leading to abrowser warwith Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft created its owninterpretercalledJScript.[17]
Microsoft first released JScript in 1996, alongside initial support forCSSand extensions toHTML. Each of theseimplementationswas noticeably different from their counterparts inNetscape Navigator.[18][19]These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.[18][20]
## The rise of JScript
In November 1996,Netscapesubmitted JavaScript toEcma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the firstECMAScriptlanguage specification in June 1997.
The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[17]
However, the effort to fully standardize the language was undermined byMicrosoftgaining an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s,Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[21]This meant thatJScriptbecame the de facto standard forclient-side scriptingon the Web.
Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.
## Growth and standardization
During the period ofInternet Explorerdominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape,Mozilla, released theFirefoxbrowser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[22]
In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on theECMAScript for XML(E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly withMacromedia(later acquired byAdobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released theTamarinimplementation as anopen sourceproject. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation fromMicrosoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.
Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005,Jesse James Garrettreleased a white paper in which he coined the termAjaxand described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to createweb applicationswhere data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, includingjQuery,Prototype,Dojo Toolkit, andMooTools.
Googledebuted itsChromebrowser in 2008, with theV8JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition.[23][24]The key innovation wasjust-in-time compilation(JIT),[25]so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.[26]
In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference inOslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.
## Reaching maturity
Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication ofECMAScript6 in 2015.[27]
The creation ofNode.jsin 2009 byRyan Dahlsparked a significant increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node combines theV8engine, anevent loop, andI/OAPIs, thereby providing a stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[28][29]As of 2018, Node had been used by millions of developers,[30]andnpmhad the most modules of anypackage managerin the world.[31]
The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly onGitHub,[32]and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[32]Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process.[33][34]Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.[32]
The current JavaScript ecosystem has manylibrariesandframeworks, established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise ofsingle-page applicationsand other JavaScript-heavy websites, severaltranspilershave been created to aid the development process.[35]
