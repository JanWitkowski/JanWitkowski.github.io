#History of PHP
##Early history[edit]
PHP development began in 1993[9]whenRasmus Lerdorfwrote severalCommon Gateway Interface(CGI) programs inC,[20][21]which he used to maintain hispersonal homepage. He extended them to work withweb formsand to communicate withdatabases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
An example of the early PHPsyntax:[22]
PHP/FI could be used to build simple,dynamic web applications. To acceleratebugreporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" on theUsenetdiscussion groupcomp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgion 8 June 1995.[1][23]This release included basic functionality such asPerl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embedHTML. By this point, thesyntaxhad changed to resemble that ofPerl, but was simpler, more limited, and less consistent.[12][11]
Early PHP was never intended to be a newprogramming language; rather, it grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it [...] there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language [...] I just kept adding the next logical step on the way."[24]A development team began to form and, after months of work andbetatesting, officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997[25].[citation needed]
The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters.[26]In some cases, the function names were chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was "wrapping",[27]while in some very early versions of PHP the length of the function names was used internally as ahash function, so names were chosen to improve the distribution ofhash values.[28]
##PHP 3 and 4[edit]
Zeev SuraskiandAndi Gutmansrewrote theparserin 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to therecursive acronymPHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[11][29]Afterwards, public testing of PHP 3 began, and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a newrewriteof PHP's core, producing theZend Enginein 1999.[30]They also foundedZend TechnologiesinRamat Gan,Israel.[11]
On 22 May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.[11]By August 2008, this branch had reached version 4.4.9. PHP 4 is now no longer under development and nor are any security updates planned to be released.[31][32]
##PHP 5[edit]
On 1 July 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine II.[11]PHP 5 included new features such as improved support forobject-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension (which defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous performance enhancements.[33]In 2008, PHP 5 became the only stable version under development.Late static bindinghad been missing from previous versions of PHP, and was added in version 5.3.[34][35]
Many high-profile open-source projects ceased to support PHP 4 in new code from February 5, 2008, because of the GoPHP5 initiative,[36]provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4 to PHP 5.[37][38]
Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing32-bitand64-bitoperating systems, either by building them from the PHP source code or by using pre-built binaries.[39]For PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the only availableMicrosoft Windowsbinary distributions were 32-bitIA-32builds,[40][41]requiring Windows 32-bit compatibility mode while usingInternet Information Services(IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. PHP version 5.5 made the 64-bitx86-64builds available for Microsoft Windows.[42]
Official security support for PHP 5.6 ended on 31 December 2018.[43]
##PHP 6 and Unicode[edit]
PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking nativeUnicodesupport at the core language level.[44][45]In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring nativeUnicodesupport throughout PHP, by embedding theInternational Components for Unicode(ICU) library, and representing text strings asUTF-16internally.[46]Since this would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features then in development.[47]
However, a shortage of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project.[48]As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP 6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project in its current form was officially abandoned, and a PHP 5.4 release was prepared to contain most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP 6, such as traits and closure re-binding.[49]Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but by 2014 none had been adopted.[citation needed]
##PHP 7[edit]
During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, PHP 7. The numbering of this version involved some debate among internal developers.[50]While the PHP 6 Unicode experiments had never been released, several articles and book titles referenced the PHP 6 names, which might have caused confusion if a new release were to reuse the name.[51]After a vote, the name PHP 7 was chosen.[52]
The foundation of PHP 7 is a PHPbranchthat was originally dubbedPHP next generation(phpng). It was authored by Dmitry Stogov, Xinchen Hui and Nikita Popov,[53]and aimed to optimize PHP performance by refactoring the Zend Engine while retaining near-complete language compatibility.[54]By 14 July 2014,WordPress-based benchmarks, which served as the main benchmark suite for the phpng project, showed an almost 100% increase in performance. Changes from phpng make it easier to improve performance in future versions, as more compact data structures and other changes are seen as better suited for a successful migration to ajust-in-time(JIT) compiler.[55]Because of the significant changes, the reworked Zend Engine was calledZend Engine 3, succeeding Zend Engine 2 used in PHP 5.[56]
Because of the major internal changes in phpng, it must receive a newmajor versionnumber of PHP, rather than a minor PHP 5 release, according to PHP's release process.[57]Major versions of PHP are allowed to break backward-compatibility of code and therefore PHP 7 presented an opportunity for other improvements beyond phpng that require backward-compatibility breaks.[citation needed]In particular, it involved the following changes:
PHP 7 also included new language features. Most notably, it introduced return type declarations for functions[70]which complement the existing parameter type declarations, and support for thescalartypes (integer, float, string, and boolean) in parameter and return type declarations.[71]
##PHP 8[edit]
PHP 8 was released on 26 November 2020, and is currently the second-most used PHP major version. PHP 8 is a major version and has breaking changes from previous versions.[72][73]New features and notable changes include:
###Just-in-time compilation[edit]
Just-in-time compilationis supported in PHP 8.[74]
PHP 8'sJIT compilercan provide substantial performance improvements for some use cases,[75][76]while PHP developer Nikita Popov stated that the performance improvements for most websites will be less substantial than the upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7.[77]Substantial improvements are expected more for mathematical-type operations than for common web-development use cases.[77]Additionally, the JIT compiler provides the future potential to move some code from C to PHP, due to the performance improvements for some use cases.[78]
###Addition of the match expression[edit]
PHP 8 introduced thematchexpression.[79]The match expression is conceptually similar to aswitchstatement and is more compact for some use cases.[80]Becausematchis an expression, its result can be assigned to a variable or returned from a function.[81]
###Type changes and additions[edit]
PHP 8 introduced union types, a newstaticreturn type, and a newmixedtype.[72]
"Attributes", often referred to as "annotations" in other programming languages, were added in PHP 8, which allow metadata to be added to classes.[72]
throwwas changed from being a statement to being an expression.[82]This allows exceptions to be thrown in places that were not previously possible.[72]
###Syntax changes and additions[edit]
PHP 8 includes changes to allow alternate, more concise, or more consistent syntaxes in a number of scenarios. For example, the nullsafe operator is similar to thenull coalescing operator??, but used when calling methods.[83]The following code snippet will not throw an error ifgetBirthday()returns null:
Constructor property promotion has been added as "syntactic sugar," allowing class properties to be set automatically when parameters are passed into a classconstructor.[72]This reduces the amount ofboilerplate codethat must be written.[citation needed]
Other minor changes include support for use of::classon objects, which serves as an alternative for the use ofget_class();[72]non-capturing catches in try-catch blocks; variable syntax tweaks to resolve inconsistencies; support for named arguments; and support for trailing commas in parameter lists, which adds consistency with support for trailing commas in other contexts, such as in arrays.[citation needed]
###Standard library changes and additions[edit]
###Additional changes[edit]
##PHP 8.1[edit]
PHP 8.1 was released on November 25, 2021.[87]It added support forenumerations(also called "enums"), declaring properties asreadonly(which prevents modification of the property after initialization), and array unpacking with string keys. The newnever typecan be used to indicate that a function does not return.[88]
##PHP 8.2[edit]
PHP 8.2 was released on December 8, 2022.[89]New in this release arereadonlyclasses (whose instance properties are implicitly readonly),disjunctive normal form(DNF) types, and therandomextension, which provides apseudorandom number generatorwith an object-orientedAPI.[90]
##Release history[edit]
Beginning on 28 June 2011, the PHP Development Team implemented a timeline for the release of new versions of PHP.[57]Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.
