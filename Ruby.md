# History of Ruby
![/assets/Ruby.png](/assets/Ruby.png)
## Early concept[edit]
Matsumoto has said that Ruby was conceived in 1993. In a 1999 post to theruby-talkmailing list, he describes some of his early ideas about the language:[11]
Matsumoto describes the design of Ruby as being like a simpleLisplanguage at its core, with an object system like that of Smalltalk, blocks inspired byhigher-order functions, and practical utility like that of Perl.[12]He praised the language for its ingenuity and creativity for its solution for compiling intervals.
The name "Ruby" originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language.[13]Initially two names were proposed: "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka.[14]Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name "Ruby" it was thebirthstoneof one of his colleagues.[15][16]
## Early releases[edit]
The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domesticnewsgroupson December 21, 1995.[17][18]Subsequently, three more versions of Ruby were released in two days.[13]The release coincided with the launch of theJapanese-languageruby-listmailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language.
Already present at this stage of development were many of the features familiar in later releases of Ruby, includingobject-orienteddesign,classeswith inheritance,mixins,iterators,closures,exception handlingandgarbage collection.[19]
After the release of Ruby 0.95 in 1995, several stable versions of Ruby were released in these years:
In 1997, the first article about Ruby was published on the Web. In the same year, Matsumoto was hired by netlab.jp to work on Ruby as a full-time developer.[13]
In 1998, the Ruby Application Archive was launched by Matsumoto, along with a simple English-language homepage for Ruby.[13]

By 2000, Ruby was more popular than Python in Japan.[21]In September 2000, the first English language bookProgramming Rubywas printed, which was later freely released to the public, further widening the adoption of Ruby amongst English speakers. In early 2002, the English-languageruby-talkmailing list was receiving more messages than the Japanese-languageruby-list, demonstrating Ruby's increasing popularity in the non-Japanese speaking world.
## Ruby 1.8 and 1.9[edit]
Ruby 1.8 was initially released August 2003, was stable for a long time, and was retired June 2013.[22]Although deprecated, there is still code based on it. Ruby 1.8 is only partially compatible with Ruby 1.9.
Ruby 1.8 has been the subject of several industry standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (aJapanese governmentagency) for submission to theJapanese Industrial Standards Committee(JISC) and then to theInternational Organization for Standardization(ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS X 3017) in 2011[23]and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in 2012.[24][25]
Around 2005, interest in the Ruby language surged in tandem withRuby on Rails, aweb frameworkwritten in Ruby. Rails is frequently credited with increasing awareness of Ruby.[26]
Effective with Ruby 1.9.3, released October 31, 2011,[27]Ruby switched from being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the GPL to being dual-licensed under the Ruby License and the two-clause BSD license.[28]Adoption of 1.9 was slowed by changes from 1.8 that required many popular third partygemsto be rewritten. Ruby 1.9 introduces many significant changes over the 1.8 series. Examples include:[29]
## Ruby 2[edit]
Ruby 2.0 was intended to be fully backward compatible with Ruby 1.9.3. As of the official 2.0.0 release on February 24, 2013, there were only five known (minor) incompatibilities.[30]Ruby 2.0 added several new features, including:
Starting with 2.1.0, Ruby's versioning policy changed to be more similar tosemantic versioning.[32]
Ruby 2.2.0 includes speed-ups, bugfixes, and library updates and removes some deprecated APIs. Most notably, Ruby 2.2.0 introduces changes to memory handling   an incremental garbage collector, support for garbage collection of symbols and the option to compile directly against jemalloc. It also contains experimental support for usingvfork(2) with system() and spawn(), and added support for theUnicode7.0 specification. Since version 2.2.1,[33]Ruby MRIperformance onPowerPC64was improved.[34][35][36]Features that were made obsolete or removed include callcc, the DL library, Digest::HMAC, lib/rational.rb, lib/complex.rb, GServer, Logger::Application as well as various C API functions.[37]
Ruby 2.3.0 includes many performance improvements, updates, and bugfixes including changes to Proc#call, Socket and IO use of exception keywords, Thread#name handling, default passive Net::FTP connections, and Rake being removed from stdlib.[38]Other notable changes include:
Ruby 2.4.0 includes performance improvements to hash table, Array#max, Array#min, and instance variable access.[40]Other notable changes include:
A few notable changes in Ruby 2.5.0 includerescueandensurestatements automatically use a surroundingdo-endblock (less need for extrabegin-endblocks), method-chaining withyield_self, support for branch coverage and method coverage measurement, and easier Hash transformations withHash#sliceandHash#transform_keysOn top of that come a lot of performance improvements like faster block passing (3 times faster), faster Mutexes, faster ERB templates and improvements on some concatenation methods.
A few notable changes in Ruby 2.6.0 include an experimentaljust-in-time compiler(JIT), andRubyVM::AbstractSyntaxTree(experimental).
A few notable changes in Ruby 2.7.0 include pattern Matching (experimental), REPL improvements, a compaction GC, and separation of positional and keyword arguments.
## Ruby 3[edit]
Ruby 3.0.0 was released onChristmasDay in 2020.[41]It is known as Ruby 3x3 which means that programs would run three times faster in Ruby 3.0 comparing to Ruby 2.0.[42]and some had already implemented in intermediate releases on the road from 2 to 3. To achieve 3x3, Ruby 3 comes with MJIT, and later YJIT, Just-In-Time Compilers, to make programs faster, although they are described as experimental and remain disabled by default (enabled by flags at runtime).
Another goal of Ruby 3.0 is to improveconcurrencyand two more utilities Fibre Scheduler, and experimental Ractor facilitate the goal.[41]Ractor is light-weight and thread-safe as it is achieved by exchanging messages rather than shared objects.
Ruby 3.0 introduces RBS language to describe the types of Ruby programs forstatic analysis.[41]It is separated from general Ruby programs.
There are some syntax enhancements and library changes in Ruby 3.0 as well.[41]
Ruby 3.1 was released on Christmas Day in 2021.[43]It includes YJIT, a new, experimental, Just-In-Time Compiler developed byShopify, to enhance the performance of real world business applications. A newdebuggeris also included. There are some syntax enhancements and other improvements in this release. Network libraries forFTP,SMTP,IMAP, andPOPare moved from default gems to bundled gems.[44]
Ruby 3.2 was released on Christmas Day in 2022.[45]It brings support for being run inside of aWebAssemblyenvironment via a WASI interface.Regular expressionsalso receives some improvements, including a faster,memoizedmatching algorithm to protect against certainReDoSattacks, and configurable timeouts for regular expression matching. Additional debugging and syntax features are also included in this release, which include syntax suggestion, as well as error highlighting. The MJIT compiler has been re-implemented as a standard library module, while the YJIT, aRust-basedJITcompiler now supports more architectures on Linux.
Ruby 3.3 was released on December 25, 2023.[1]Ruby 3.3 introduces significant enhancements and performance improvements to the language. Key features include the introduction of the Prism parser for portable and maintainable parsing, the addition of the pure-Ruby JIT compiler RJIT, and major performance boosts in the YJIT compiler. Additionally, improvements in memory usage, the introduction of an M:N thread scheduler, and updates to the standard library contribute to a more efficient and developer-friendly Ruby ecosystem.
