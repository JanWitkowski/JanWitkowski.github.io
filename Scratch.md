In the early 2000s, theMIT Media Lab'sLifelong Kindergartengroup (LLK) was developing visual programming languages targeted towards children.[47]In 2003,Mitchel Resnick,Yasmin Kafai, andJohn Maedawere awarded aNational Science Foundationgrant for the development of a new programming environment for children to express themselves with code.[9]The LLK, led by Mitchel Resnick, in partnership withYasmin Kafai's team atUCLAworked closely withComputer Clubhousesin Boston and Los Angeles to develop Scratch, grounding its design in the practices and social dynamics of these after-school youth centers.[9]It started as a basic programming language, with no labeled categories and no green flag.[48]Similar to AgentSheets[49]Scratch employed concepts of Tactile Programming later known as blocks-based programming. Scratch was made with the intention to teach kids to program.[48]
The philosophy of Scratch encourages the sharing, reuse, and combination of code, as indicated by the team slogan, "Imagine, Program, Share".[50]Users can make their own projects, or they may choose to "remix" someone else's project. Projects created and remixed with Scratch are licensed under theCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License.[51]Scratch automatically gives credit to the user who created the original project and program in the top part of the project page.[11]
Scratch was developed based on ongoing interaction with youth and staff at Computer Clubhouses. The use of Scratch at Computer Clubhouses served as a model for other after-school centers demonstrating how informal learning settings can support the development of technological fluency.[52]
Scratch 2.0 was released on 9 May 2013.[13]The update changed the look of the site and included both an online project editor and an offline editor.[53]Custom blocks could now be defined within projects, along with several other improvements.[54]The Scratch 2.0 Offline editor could be downloaded for Windows, Mac, and Linux directly from Scratch's website, although support for Linux was later dropped. The unofficialmobileversion had to be downloaded from the Scratch forums.[55][56]
Scratch 3.0 was first announced by the Scratch Team in 2016. Several public alpha versions were released between then and January 2018, after which the pre-beta "Preview" versions were released.[57]A beta version of Scratch 3.0 was released on 1 August 2018.[58]for use on most browsers; with the notable exception ofInternet Explorer.[59]
Scratch 3.0, the first 3.x release version, was released on 2 January 2019.[60]On 28 June 2023,[61]the header and links on the Scratch Website changed from blue to purple, and new optional high-contrast block colors were introduced, to make the site easier for colorblind people to read and use.[62]
