# History of Swift
![/assets/Swift.png](/assets/Swift.png)
Development of Swift started in July 2010 byChris Lattner, with the eventual collaboration of many other programmers atApple. Swift was motivated by the need for a replacement for Apple's earlier programming languageObjective-C, which had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift took language ideas "fromObjective-C,Rust,Haskell,Ruby,Python,C#,CLU, and far too many others to list".[7]On June 2, 2014, theApple Worldwide Developers Conference(WWDC) application became the first publicly released app written with Swift.[25]Abeta versionof theprogramming languagewas released to registered Apple developers at the conference, but the company did not promise that the final version of Swift would besource codecompatible with the test version. Apple planned to make source code converters available if needed for the full release.[25]
The Swift Programming Language, a free 500-page manual, was also released at WWDC, and is available on theApple BooksStore and the official website.[26]
Swift reached the 1.0 milestone on September 9, 2014, with theGold MasterofXcode6.0 foriOS.[27]Swift 1.1 was released on October 22, 2014, alongside the launch of Xcode 6.1.[28]Swift 1.2 was released on April 8, 2015, along with Xcode 6.3.[29]Swift 2.0 was announced at WWDC 2015, and was made available for publishing apps in the App Store on September 21, 2015.[30]Swift 3.0 was released on September 13, 2016.[31]Swift 4.0 was released on September 19, 2017.[32]Swift 4.1 was released on March 29, 2018.[33]
Swift won first place forMost Loved Programming Languagein theStack OverflowDeveloper Survey 2015[34]and second place in 2016.[35]
On December 3, 2015, the Swift language, supporting libraries, debugger, and package manager were open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license with a Runtime Library Exception,[36]andSwift.orgwas created to host the project. The source code is hosted onGitHub, where it is easy for anyone to get the code, build it themselves, and even create pull requests to contribute code back to the project.
In December 2015,IBMannounced its Swift Sandbox website, which allows developers to write Swift code in one pane and display output in another.[37][38][39]The Swift Sandbox was deprecated in January 2018.[40]
During theWWDC 2016, Apple announced aniPadexclusiveapp, namedSwift Playgrounds, intended to teach people how to code in Swift. The app is presented in a3D video game-likeinterface which provides feedback when lines of code are placed in a certain order and executed.[41][42][43]
In January 2017, Chris Lattner announced his departure from Apple for a new position withTesla Motors, with the Swift project lead role going to team veteran Ted Kremenek.[44][45]
During WWDC 2019, Apple announced SwiftUI with Xcode 11, which provides a framework fordeclarativeUI structure design across all Apple platforms.[46]
Official downloads for theUbuntudistribution of Linux have been available since Swift 2.2, with more distros added since Swift 5.2.4,CentOSand Amazon Linux.[47]There is an unofficial SDK and native toolchain package for Android too.[48][49]
## Platforms[edit]
The platforms Swift supports are Apple's operating systems (Darwin,iOS,iPadOS,macOS,tvOS,watchOS),Linux,Windows, andAndroid.[50][51]
A key aspect of Swift's design is its ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades, such asCocoaand theCocoa Touchframeworks. On Apple platforms,[52]it links with the Objective-Cruntime library, which allowsC,Objective-C,C++and Swift code to run within one program.[53]
